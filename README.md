# Dart Challenges Lab
Welcome to the Dart Challenges Lab! In this lab, you'll apply your Dart programming skills to solve a series of tasks designed to deepen your understanding of Dart's features and capabilities.

## Guidelines
Use Dart Documentation: Refer to the official Dart documentation for help with syntax and standard library functions.
Write Clean Code: Ensure your code is well-organized and easy to read. Use meaningful variable names and comments where necessary.
Test Your Code: Test your functions and classes with different inputs to ensure they work as expected.

### 💡 Challenge 1: Recipe Manager 🥘
Create a Dart program that uses a `Map` to manage recipes. Each recipe is stored with a name (String) as the key and a list of ingredients (List of Strings) as the value. Implement functions to:

- Add a new recipe.
- Remove a recipe by name.
- List all recipes and their ingredients.
- Search for a recipe by name and display its ingredients.
